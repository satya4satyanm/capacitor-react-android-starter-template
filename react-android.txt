   There is no need of android license key
   when you want to build an app for your
   own phone for personal use…



   And of course, you can distribute it to
   your friends and relatives



   Let’s start
Quick Android App

   Prerequisites

   • Visual Studio Code for a quick JavaScript/React/Angular App
   • Android Studio




   Go for it now…
Quick Android App

   I am using a simple react `Quick Shopping` app
   which I customized to make my grocery
   shopping experience easy…




   Here is the app url:
   https://codesandbox.io/s/simple-react-todo-list-
   mo0g05


   Next..
Quick Android App

   Let me create a
   file capacitor.config.json in the root
   folder

   Add below code into it:
   {
   "appId": "io.ionic.todo",
   "appName": " Quick Shopping ",
   "bundledWebRuntime": false,
   "npmClient": "npm",
   "webDir": "build",
   "cordova": {}
   }



   Next..
Quick Android App

   Let me create a file ionic.config.json in
   the root folder


   Add below code into it:
   {
    "name": "yourAppName",
    "integrations": {
       "capacitor": {}
    },
    "type": "react"
   }


   Next..
Quick Android App

   If you are using react app



   Run below command in command prompt
   `npm run build`


   Command prompt is opened at the root of react project

   Make sure the app runs locally


   Next..
Quick Android App

   Install CAPACITOR locally by running
   below command in command prompt


   Run below commands in command prompt


   •    `npm install @capacitor/core`
   •    `npm install @capacitor/cli --save-dev`
   •    `npx cap init`


   Using the same command prompt which was opened at the root of react project




   Next..
Quick Android App

   Make sure android studio is installed



   Run below command in command prompt
   `ionic capacitor add android`


   This will create the android folder in our project root

   * Using the same command prompt which was opened at the root of react project


   Next..
Quick Android App

   To open the project in android studio



   Run below command in command prompt
   `npx cap open android`


   This will open the project in android studio IDE

   * Using the same command prompt which was opened at the root of react project


   Next..
Quick Android App

   Now we are in Android Studio



   Run the project once it is initiated


   Now, goto the build menu and select
   `Build bundles/apks - Build apks`



   Next..
Quick Android App

   Now we have our APK ready to be run in
   our smart phone


   Locate the build folder on your system

   Send the APK to your phone using whats-app web or
   any other technique

Change the icons if needed in android - app - src - main - res

Change the version in 
android - app - build.gradle

In android - app - src - main - AndroidManifest.xml
Add inside application tag
