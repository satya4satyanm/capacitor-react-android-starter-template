   There is no need of android license key
   when you want to build an app for your
   own phone for personal use…



   And of course, you can distribute it to
   your friends and relatives



   Let’s start
Quick Android App

   shopping experience easy…

   {
   "appId": "io.ionic.yourAppName",
   "appName": " yourAppName ",
   "bundledWebRuntime": false,
   "npmClient": "npm",
   "webDir": "build",
   "cordova": {}
   }



   Next..
Quick Android App

   Let me create a file ionic.config.json in
   the root folder


   Add below code into it:
   {
    "name": "yourAppName",
    "integrations": {
       "capacitor": {}
    },
    "type": "react"
   }

   •    `npm install @capacitor/core`
   •    `npm install @capacitor/cli --save-dev`

   Next..
Quick Android App

   Make sure android studio is installed



   Run below command in command prompt

App which saves time while shopping in super markets, malls and farmer's markets

This app will help you create groups of shopping items like grocery, vegetables, items from super market, etc before you go there. Once you collect any item from the shelf in the market or mall, you can tick it so that you find the rest of the items easily.

Easily you can share the list of items through text sms or whats app or any other manner to your family members or any other person who is doing shopping on your behalf. If they are using this app, they can select, copy the comma separated items from sms and paste it in the input field inside the shopping group and then click add. It list each item separately with check boxes and remove buttons.

One can add individual items or a list of items comma separated easily inside the list.

One can check or uncheck an item and remove an item if its no more needed.
